# wugb-utils

Ths repository includes some utilities for **Washington University Genome Browser (WUGB)**.

### 1. `make_wugb_json.py`

This script scans a web server's directory (based on `servers` dict),
and saves a JSON file that includes all supported data files in this
directory.

The output JSON file can be loaded directly into WUGB.

#### 1.1 Syntax:
```
make_wugb_json.py [genome_type] [data_directory]
```

Two arguments are required by the script:
  * *genome_type*, such as `hg19` or `hg38`
  * *data_directory*, which is the location of your data files

Two new files will be generated by the script:
  * `wugb.json`: JSON file for WUGB
  * `wugb_url.txt`: the URL of WUGB (also in *standard output* when the script is done)
  
#### 1.2 Example
Suppose your *data_directory* is `my_data`, which has the following structure:
```
my_data/
├── d1
│   └── f1.bw
└── d2
    ├── f2.bw
    └── f3.bw
```
After you run: 
```
make_wugb_json.py hg38 my_data
```
the structure of `my_data` will become:
```
my_data/
├── d1
│   └── f1.bw
├── d2
│   ├── f2.bw
│   └── f3.bw
├── wugb.json
└── wugb_url.txt
```
